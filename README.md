Simple rock, paper scissors

This application should be a small project to test the skills I've learned so far in the Odin Project.
It will be the first time I do a full project on my own in JavaScript.
I want to use the problem solving skills I've been told by the guys behind the Odin Project.

So rock, paper and scissors might be a simple game, but it will take some time to achieve this with the knowledge I've got so far.

The idea is that the user is playing against the computer.

The player chooses if he/she wants to go with either rock, paper or scissors.
The computer also "chooses" a one of these three options.

Rock beats Scissors - Scissors beats Paper - Paper beats Rock
